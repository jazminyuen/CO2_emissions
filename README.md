# Greenhouse Gas Emissions of U.S. Companies

## Reasoning

Our team's chief reason for choosing this topic is our shared concern for humanity and climate change.

While Jazmin notes extreme weather in her hometowns of Dallas and Chicago, Vanessa recalls her experience scuba diving when she lived in Hawaii. She saw devastating coral bleaching due to heat stress. Carly describes her own first-hand experience of diving in the Great Barrier Reef that suffered the same mass bleaching. Astrid shares memories of trips to visit her family in Peru where she loved to see the vegetation, but in later years, the levels of beautiful vegetation had been depleted. Coupled with the experience of seeing Florida beaches full of trash, she felt led to do more research into environmental concerns.


## Data Source

Our team will be using datasets from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) which cover each year from 2011 to 2020. The GHGRP requires the reporting of facilities that are considered direct, large-emitting sources of greenhouse gases, or those emitting 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. The program estimates that this covers 85 to 90 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from more than 8,000 facilities.
