# Greenhouse Gas Emissions of U.S. Companies

## Reasoning

Our team's chief reason for choosing this topic is our shared concern for humanity and climate change.

While Jazmin notes extreme weather in her hometowns of Dallas and Chicago, Vanessa recalls her experience scuba diving when she lived in Hawaii. She saw devastating coral bleaching due to heat stress. Carly describes her own first-hand experience of diving in the Great Barrier Reef that suffered the same mass bleaching. Astrid shares memories of trips to visit her family in Peru where she loved to see the vegetation, but in later years, the levels of beautiful vegetation had been depleted. Coupled with the experience of seeing Florida beaches full of trash, she felt led to do more research into environmental concerns.


## Data Source

Our team will be using datasets from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) which cover each year from 2011 to 2020. The GHGRP requires the reporting of facilities that are considered direct, large-emitting sources of greenhouse gases, or those emitting 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. The program estimates that this covers 85 to 90 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from more than 8,000 facilities.

## Questions

Our team aims to answer the following question:
- What trends are there to be discovered with GHG emissions of U.S. companies from 2011 to 2020?

## Communication Protocols

- Scheduled Zoom check-in meetings
- Shared Google Doc to track ideas
- Slack for messaging

## Map Video
Our project was an analysis of greenhouse gas emissions reported to the EPA by over 5,000 U.S companies. To assess emissions, we created a map to depict GHG emissions by year from 2011-2020 and by popular industry type subparts. Additionally, we employed the unsupervised machine learning model, k-means classification, which grouped the total emissions from each company from 2011-2020 into high, medium, and low emitting companies. This allowed us to create a map of the U.S. that had the location of each company symbolized by a circle marker whose size correlated to relative emissions and whose color was unique for each year. Furthermore, we used the clustering model to color code the total 2011-2020 emissions (low-yellow, medium-orange, red-high) and scale them by emissions so viewers could easily see geographical emission trends as well as discover where emissions are coming from near the city they live in.

Due to time restraints on the project, we were not able to deploy this map to an app. In absence of this, we screen recorded a video of some of the map features for you to see. If you'd like to view the map on your own device, you may copy the direct_emitters_map folder into VSCode and open the index.html file with Live Server. Below is the link to the Direct Emitters Map YouTube video.
